Operation System used is Windows XP.

OS call to get the proper time: 
In our Java application, we use the System.currentTimeMillis() Java method, or the "new GregorianCalendar()" Java constructor to retrieve the current Client time. 

An open NTP software is installed on our OS to synchronize the OS to a NTP server; the NTP server we use is an NIST server(host name=time-a.nist.gov ip=129.6.15.28). In our J2EE application, we use the above method or constructor to retrieve the synchronized time. 

The syncronized time is mainly used in the following 3 scenarios:
1. Application system logging message (log4j logging is used)
 Format:
2008-12-03 15:21:48 [main] INFO com.misyshealthcare.connect.config.ConfigManager - Add Property.
2008-12-03 15:21:49 [main] INFO com.misyshealthcare.connect.pull.ClinialManager - Request Clinical Object.
...

2. Clinical time related contents
Examples:
a). Document creation time, which is used in creating a CDA document. 
	For example <effectiveTime value="20081015224411-0500"/>
b). Problem Date, which is the time that a Patient's observed problem is recorded.
c). Message Date, which is the time that a Message such as HL7v2.x is created.
        For exmaple, MSH|^~\&|EHR_MISYS|MISYS|CLINREG|WESTCLIN|20081230130023-0500||RSP^K23|PIXPDQ_1230660022015|P|2.5
        
    
3. Audit Trail logging message
Example:
<AuditMessage> 
    <EventIdentification EventActionCode="C" EventDateTime="2008-12-03T11:37:43.671-06:00" EventOutcomeIndicator="0"> 
    <EventID codeSystem="DCM" code="110104" displayName="DICOM Instances Transfered"/> 
    </EventIdentification> 
    ......
</AuditMessage>
